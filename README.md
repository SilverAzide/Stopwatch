# Stopwatch
**Stopwatch Meter Gadget inspired by the well-known AddGadgets.com Windows Sidebar gadgets.**

The Stopwatch Gadget is a simple stopwatch with styling to match the [Gadgets](https://github.com/SilverAzide/Gadgets) suite.

## Features
* Allows pausing and resuming.
* Supports elapsed times greater than 24 hours.
* Scales to any desired size.

**NOTE:**<br>
The installer is in the form of a patch, which will patch your existing [Gadgets](https://github.com/SilverAzide/Gadgets) installation without affecting your existing configuration or layouts. If you don't have the Gadgets suite installed, this will install as a standalone skin.

## Requirements
